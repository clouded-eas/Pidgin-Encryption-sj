====================
Release version:
====================

First, unpack the plugin, and cd to its directory.

Running ./configure:

  If you have Gaim installed in a system directory, you should be able to just run
  ./configure

  If you have Gaim installed in /usr/local, you may need to add /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
  to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable first.  So run it like

  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(PKG_CONFIG_PATH):/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure

  If your NSS/NSPR libraries are installed somewhere random, you may need to add
  something else to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH for them, or use one of the configure options:

--with-nspr-includes=PATH
  Specify the location of the Mozilla NSPR include files.  Make sure that
  they're installed (the Redhat package used to be mozilla-nspr-devel, and is now
  seamonkey-nss-devel, for example).
  PATH should be where the nspr.h header file was installed to.

--with-nss-includes=PATH
  Ditto, but the Mozilla NSS include files.  Redhat package is
  seamonkey-nss-devel.  Look for nssbase.h

--with-nspr-libs=PATH
  Specify the location of the NSPR runtime libraries (libnspr4.so or
  libnspr4.a)

--with-nss-libs=PATH
  Specify the location of the NSS runtime libraries (libnss3.so or
  libnss3.a)

If you specified a --prefix when compiling Gaim, you should specify it for the plugin as well.

NOTE:  If you update Gaim, you should re-compile and re-install the plugin, otherwise
you will probably see some strange behavior.
